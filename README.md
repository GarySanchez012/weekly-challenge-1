# Code Refactor Starter Code

This is a website meant to market the company and what are some of the best methods to find it whether through SEO, social media marketing, brand awareness, etc.

What I did was change the div elements into more semantic HTML elements such as section, article, header, etc.

I also commented through the CSS file to explain certain selector functions and sectioned off what certain groups of selectors were under the website itself.
